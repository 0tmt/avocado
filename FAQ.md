###Frequently Asked Questions on Avocado

####What is Avocado? Why did you do it?
Avocado is an interaction design toolbox. It enables designers to quickly create interactive prototypes—without the need to know coding. Have a look at <a href="labs.ideo.com" target="_blank">this post</a>.

####How do I get started with Quartz Composer and Avocado?

####How is Avocado different from Origami?
Avocado builds on top of Facebook’s Origami. Avocado literally includes Origami and adds a number of components (“patches”) that speed up the prototyping process.
While Origami provides some much-needed functionalities (for instance, a Color Transition, a Switch, and so on), Avocado provides ready-to-use interaction models and animations.
One of the best example is Avocado’s Carousel—having a fully working carousel of images is as simple as drag-and-dropping the Carousel patch, connecting a number of images, and... that’s it! 


####Is it possible to use Avocado with Origami? It is possible to use Avocado without Origami?
When you install Avocado you are also installing the latest version of Origami. Avocado and Origami are fully compatible. Given that Avocado relies on Origami, it is not possible to use Avocado without Origami.

####How do I test a prototype on a device?
